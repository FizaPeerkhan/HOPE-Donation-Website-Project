# HOPE: A Donation Platform for NGOs and Donors

HOPE is a web-based donation platform developed to bridge the gap between donors and NGOs. It streamlines the process of both monetary and material donations by offering a centralized, transparent, and user-friendly system. Through category-based filtering, city-wise listings, and a real-time chatbot assistant, HOPE encourages a culture of giving and social impact.
